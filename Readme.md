# Government Job Information Provider Backend

This is the backend for a job information provider website that focuses on government department positions. It provides APIs to manage and retrieve job listings and related information.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
- JWT for authentication
- Cloudinary for file storage

## Dependencies

- bcryptjs: Password hashing
- cloudinary: Cloud-based image and file storage
- compression: Response compression
- cookie-parser: Parsing cookies in requests
- cors: Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- dotenv: Environment variable management
- express: Web application framework
- jsonwebtoken: JWT implementation for authentication
- lz-string: String compression and decompression
- mongoose: MongoDB object modeling
- multer: Handling multipart/form-data for file uploads

## Project Structure

Based on your request, I'll create a README.md file that provides information about your backend project for a job information provider website. This file will help recruiters understand the technologies and dependencies used in your project.
Here's a draft of the README.md file:
